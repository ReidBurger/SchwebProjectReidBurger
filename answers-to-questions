1. How long did part 1 and 2 take you?
    Part 1 (the HTML and CSS webpage) took me 1hr 45min, and part 2 (secret password) took me 25min.

2. As we try to evaluate our final candidates, whatâ€™s something you would say sets you apart from other possible developers that we should consider?
    I think what sets me apart is my positive attitude, attention to detail, and ability to learn quickly. I make friends with coworkers and
    classmates everywhere I go and get along easily in a group setting. I'm also very detail-oriented and have an eye for design, so I do a
    great job with catching the small things before they slip through the cracks. Finally, I learn quickly-- in my recent internship, I've
    learned a ton in a very short amount of time and I've been very successful and efficient! 

3. Do you have any expectations regarding this position's wage?
    I expect to be making a salary that's competitive with other full-stack entry-level positions, which would be in the $65K-85K range. 
    Obviously, the higher the better, I would just like to be payed what I'm worth.

4. Could you provide a list of references we could call and if you're comfortable with us calling before or after extending a job offer?
